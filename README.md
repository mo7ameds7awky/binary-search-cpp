# Binary Search with C++ 

This repository contains an implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in C++. Binary Search is an efficient search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search space in half until the target element is found or determined to be absent.

## Implementation

The Binary Search algorithm is implemented in the `main.cpp` file. It includes a function called `binary_search` that takes a sorted array, the size of the array, and the target element as parameters. The function returns the index of the target element if found, or -1 if the element is not present in the array.
